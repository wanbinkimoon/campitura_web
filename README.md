# Campitura

Yet another creative collective

## Intro

**Campitura** was born in August 2015 and is based in Rome.

### Why a public repo?

Considering that our is a totally static website we do not have any reason to hide the code.<br>
In addition we believe in sharing and so we will provide alongside the code a complete set of comments who could helps people to study our work.<br>
We will provide any sort of file we have produced to create this website.

## Usage

To start mess with the code `cd` into the root folder and run

```
npm run dev
```

Once you have done and you wanna create your minified files and inline everything run

```
NODE_ENV=production webpack
```
